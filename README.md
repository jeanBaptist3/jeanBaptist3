## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a computer scientist student at the Technical University of Munich.
My interests include stuff like cybersecurity, deep learning , complexity theory, formal verification, cooking and all sorts of things. I just use this account for my personal projects and handling my university stuff when I am working from different setups.
